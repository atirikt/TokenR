# TokenR
sub-delta
ERC20 token. importable contracts.

Fungible coins which can be earned participating on the platform. The contracts need to be as modular & inheritable as possible. The user can spend smart contract coin(eth/dot/ada) and this could be the medium of earning/incentive instead of fiat if permitted by user. The client at the back end could decide to pay the user upon participation if accepted by user. This token could provide benefits on ERC 751/1155 trades upon other coins/fiat. The token could be exchanged on same platform.


supply increase- inversly proportional to number of TokenR-TokenR transactions. on the lines of (avg transaction in day-2to day-9) / (transactions in day-1) * constant
Staking - TBD.
